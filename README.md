# Face-detection-Open-CV

Face Detection with Haar Cascade Classifier
This repository demonstrates a real-time face detection system using OpenCV and Haar Cascade Classifiers. It's a beginner-friendly, practical project showcasing how computer vision works in real-time using Python.

🚀 Features
Real-time face detection using your webcam.
Green rectangles highlight detected faces in the video feed.
Simple, lightweight, and easy-to-understand implementation.

💡 Fun Fact
The Haar Cascade Classifier is based on research by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in 2001, making it a classic approach for object detection. Even today, it’s widely used in face detection systems!

📋 Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:
Python 3.6 or above
OpenCV Library

🖼️ Example Output
The program will display a live video feed from your webcam, with green rectangles drawn around detected faces:
